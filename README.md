### Project Description
Our project is a digital pet frog. It tells you random puns and fun froggy facts.
It jumps by and make bubbles! It also follows wherever your cursor goes, so you will never be lonely while doing your mundane tasks. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are solving boredom with something more boring and cute.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Since people are suffering from mental illness today, we thought a little friend might keep you happy and engaged.
We have created an app that can be used to launch our little froggie as a widget to your desktop.
We have also created a website which can be used to interact with him.


## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Nodejs



## Implementation

### Software

The implementation of the *Useless Project* involved creating both a website and a desktop application using a combination of web technologies and Node.js. Below are the key components of the implementation:

1. **Website**
   - **HTML**: The structure of the website is built using HTML, which includes the layout and elements for displaying the frog and interactive components.
   - **CSS**: Styles are applied to enhance the visual appeal of the website. This includes designing the frog's appearance, positioning, and animations.
   - **JavaScript**: Interactivity is achieved using JavaScript. It handles events such as mouse movements, clicks, and the logic for selecting and displaying random quotes. 
   - **Libraries**: Any additional libraries (e.g., for animations or audio playback) that were utilized in the project.

2. **Desktop App**
   - **Node.js**: The desktop application is built using Node.js, which allows for the creation of a cross-platform application. 
   - **Electron**:  The application is packaged using Electron, which enables web technologies to be used for desktop applications. This allows the app to run on various operating systems while maintaining a consistent user interface.
   - **NPM Packages**: Various Node.js packages are utilized to simplify development and enhance functionality. The main dependencies are installed via `npm install`.

3. **Development Process**
   - The development process involved iterative design and testing, ensuring that the application responds correctly to user interactions. 
   - Testing was performed to validate the functionality of the frog's movements, the randomness of quotes, and the jumping animations.
   - Debugging tools and browser developer tools were used extensively to identify and fix issues throughout the development process.

4. **References**
   - For assistance in structuring the project and generating ideas, I referred to **ChatGPT**, which provided valuable insights and guidance For document creation and assistance in javascript kodutho

## Run
To run the project, use the following commands:

### For the Website:
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/useless-project.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd useless-project/website
   
3. **Open the index.html File in Your Browser**

    - Double-click the index.html file or use a live server extension if using a code editor like Visual Studio Code.
   
**For the Desktop App (Node.js):**
  

1. **Navigate to the Desktop App Directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../desktop-app
   
2. **Install Dependencies**

  - This command will create a folder containing an executable .exe file and other necessary app resources.


   

## Project Documentation

### Software

This section provides detailed documentation of the software components used in the *Useless Project*, including design decisions, functionality, and structure.

#### 1. Overview
The *Useless Project* consists of a website and a desktop application featuring an interactive frog that entertains users with random quotes and animations. The software is designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and engaging.

#### 2. Architecture
- **Website**: The website serves as the main user interface, where users can interact with the frog. It is built with standard web technologies, ensuring compatibility across various browsers.
- **Desktop App**: The desktop application provides a similar experience as the website but is designed to run natively on the user's operating system using Node.js and Electron.
