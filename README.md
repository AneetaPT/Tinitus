# Froggie Friend 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name:Tinitus


### Team Members

### Project Description
Our project is a digital pet frog. It tells you random puns and fun froggy facts.
It jumps by and make bubbles! It also follows wherever your cursor goes, so you will never be lonely while doing your mundane tasks. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are solving boredom with something more boring and cute.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Since people are suffering from mental illness today, we thought a little friend might keep you happy and engaged.
We have created an app that can be used to launch our little froggie as a widget to your desktop.
We have also created a website which can be used to interact with him.
